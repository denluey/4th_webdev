	<p style = "font-size: 25px;text-align: center; color: white" class="emphasis comicEmphasis"> Due to the effects of the prison industrial complex, multiple different groups have been negativly effected. Women find themselves treated unfairly and violated by the prisons they are kept in, with no hope of reform due to the greedy nature of companies who profit off of the prisons. And not only women, but minorities find themselves occupying 70 percent of the prison population</p>
